									The X-34 was a civilian landspeeder of mundane design produced by SoroSuub
									Corporation. Built with a powerful repulsorlift engine augmented with three
									air-cooled thrust turbines, the X-34 hovered up to a meter off the ground during
									operation. The vehicles were capable of crossing rough terrain, and were well-suited
									for harsh desert climates. Owners could choose from either an open-air or sealed
									cockpit, although the speeders lacked any form of combat capability in the form of
									weapon mounts or armor. The X-34 was fast, if fairly nondescript in appearance, and
									measured 3.4 meters in length. X-34 landspeeders utilized by the Alliance to Restore
									the Republic were retrofitted with blaster cannons.
