									Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one
									of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia
									and Han Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage,
									and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A generation later, the location of the famed
									Jedi master was one of the galaxy&apos;s greatest mysteries. Haunted by Ben
									Solo&apos;s fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end, Luke sought exile on a
									distant world, ignoring the galaxy&apos;s pleas for help. But his solitude would be
									interrupted â€“ and Luke Skywalker had one final, momentous role to play in the
									struggle between good and evil.
